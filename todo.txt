* I should create a road map for this project


* What state management library will I configure? - I think that it is better to go with Xstate because, 
  I am already using vite, tailwind, vitest, react-router v7(remix) for this project. If I add more
  friction on this project, I will lose interest on this project



* I should finalize what folder structure I will follow



* LATER: folllow this route config -> hostname/questions/javaScript/:questionName
 but for now, while practising code, just write the function and add a todo comment to add test cases
